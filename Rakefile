client to the server.  The other is used for remote calls made from the server to the client.

Each end publishes a single object on which
methods can be called by the remote end.  All calls to the remote objects are asyncronous.  Do not make any blocking
calls in the published object.  Responses are return by calling the "reply method on the responder object.}
